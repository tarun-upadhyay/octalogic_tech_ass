# Project Overview

# Octalogic Tech Full Stack Coding Assignment.

---

The goal of this project is to design and implement a form that collects user information and details about the vehicle to be rented, along with the rental dates. The form will enable users to provide necessary information for renting a vehicle, including personal details, vehicle specifications, and rental dates. This information will be used to process the rental request and manage the rental period efficiently. The form should be user-friendly, intuitive, and secure, ensuring that users can easily enter the required information and submit their rental request.
